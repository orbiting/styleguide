## Webfonts

We have seven font cuts:

- `serifTitle`
- `serifRegular`
- `serifItalic`
- `serifBold`
- `sansSerifRegular`
- `sansSerifItalic`
- `sansSerifMedium`
- `cursiveTitle`

Full font family definitions are available as `fontFamilies` export from the style guide.

```code|lang-js
import {fontFamilies} from '@project-r/styleguide'
```

```react|no-source
<pre style={{overflow: 'auto'}}>
    <code>
    {JSON.stringify(fontFamilies, null, 2)}
    </code>
</pre>
```

A helper function to generate the `@font-face` css is available as `fontFaces`.

### Next.js example

1. Copy the font files to `/static/fonts`
2. Include the following in your `pages/_document.js`:

```code|lang-js
import {fontFaces} from '@project-r/styleguide'

<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: fontFaces() }} />
```

## Font styles

A font style combines a font cut with a font size, line height, letter spacing, text transform etc. The styles are made available as plain JavaScript objects which can be mixed into glamor css objects, or used directly in inline styles.

Font styles don't include colors, margins, nor do they make use of media queries.

```code|lang-js
import {colors: {text}, fontStyles: {serifRegular21}} from '@project-r/styleguide'

<div {...css({...serifRegular21, color: text})}>â€¦</div>
```

  <Editorial.P>
    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
  </Editorial.P>
  <Editorial.Subhead>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Editorial.Subhead>
  <Editorial.P>
    The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream.
  </Editorial.P>
  <Editorial.P>
     His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
