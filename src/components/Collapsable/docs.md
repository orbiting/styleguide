A `<Collapsable />` wraps content that should be collapsed by default and can be expanded on click.

Supported props:
- `collapsable`: Whether the content should be collapsable.
- `height`: Object defining `mobile` and `desktop` pixel height in collapsed state (defaults to `{mobile: 180, desktop: 240}`).
- `threshold`: We won't collapse a comment if it just slightly exceeds the heights above. This threshold can be adjusted here in pixels (defaults to 50).
- `style`: An optional style object.

Used in [Comment Body](/components/discussion/internal#body) and [Infobox](/infobox#collapsable).

    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
